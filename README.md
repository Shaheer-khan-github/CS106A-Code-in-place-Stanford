### How to configure Karel with Pycharm is written in "Karel_In_Pycharm" pdf file.


### Each folder of Assignment has a pdf file with the Assignment number that explains the questions or tasks that need to be done. 

### Similarly, Each folder of Assignment has a subfolder of Assignment which contains the required import files to run the code.

#### Make Sure that the path set for karel libraries is either relative or absolute.
